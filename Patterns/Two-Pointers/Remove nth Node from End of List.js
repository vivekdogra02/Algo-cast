 * Optimized approach using two pointers#
 *
 * Steps
 * Two pointers, left and right, are set at the head node.
 * Move the right pointer n steps forward. After doing that,
 * both pointers are exactly separated by n nodes apart.
 * Start moving both pointers forward until the right pointer reaches the last node.
 * At this point, the left pointer will be pointing to the node before the target node, i.e nth nod
 *  We relink the left node to the node next to left pointerâ€™s next node.
 *
 * If the right pointer reaches NULL while moving it n steps forward,
 * it means that the head node should be removed. We return the head's next node.

1. Given an array of sets find the one that does not belong:
example: [[a,b,c,d], [a,b,f,g], [a,b,h,i], [j,k,l,m]]
output: [j,k,l,m]

We can see above that the first three sets have a subset [a,b,c] and 
the last one does not.
 Note: There may be a case where the outlier set does have elements contained in the input group. 
 In this case we have the find the set that has the least in common with the other sets.

 2. Given a list of 2d points, if any two points have distance(straight line) <= k , group them together. 
 For example. [P1,P2,P3], P1 to P2 <=k, P2 to p3<=k, p1 to p3>k. they are still in the same group.
  (distance relationship is chainable ) ask how many groups can you find ? 
 I can think of N^2 time complexity with union and find. but how to do better than that? maybe NlogN or O(N)?

 3. There's a list of (x,y) points and a method getCircle with the following signature:

/**
* Given three points returns a circle (Radius, and center) such that all three points lie in its circumference
* or it returns null if no such circle is possible.
*/
Circle getCircle(point1, point2, point3);
getCircle method is already implemented and given to you as a black box. 
The problems asks you to find the Circle with most points in its perimeter.

The obvious answer is to get all possible triplets of points and 
find all possible circles and keep track of which one appears most often O(n^3) .
 Any ideas on how to further optimize this?


 4. You have a table :
        Rule1 Rule2 Rule3 Value
        A1 B2 C3 40
        A1 B1 C1 20
        A2 B2 C2 10
        A1 B1 C1 40
        * B1 * 20
        A5 B2 * 10

Now if I have a condition A1 && B2 && C3 i will get output as 40.
If I input A1 && B1 && C1 I will get two results 40 and 20 here there the rule is ambiguous.
"-" in table means any rule, 5th row matches with any row with B1 as rule2, so there is also ambiguity in result.

Now given that table as input (m * n) where n is number of available rules combination (here its 6) and
m rules (3 in this case) , 
output if the table is ambiguous i.e it will output two different result for same query.

5. Given a set of horizontal and vertical line segments, find the number of squares formed by them?

6. find nearest word from the given non-english dictionary which is one off character. (could be non ascii characters)
for eg. dictionary contains { apple, pineapple, banana, orange }

if given word "applx" then return true, as applx matches with apple and only one character is off.
aplpe returns false

7. A mobile phone company wants to deploy network of cell towers to provide good signal coverage for its customers.
But it doesn't want to have too many towers because they can interfere with one another.
All towers are laid out over a 2-dimensional surface and that towers have same sized circular signal zone.
You can determine whether their signal zones will overlap in 0 1) time.
Give a parallel algorithm for choosing maximal subset of towers that cover non-overlapping areas.

I was not sure if this can be solved using DP?

8. If ads were removed from YouTube, how would you monetize it?--

9. A stream of data representing the price of a commodity is being read. The data is of the format 
(price:Int, timestamp:Option[Long]).
If the timestamp is missing, it means the price has to be deleted.
If timestamp is old, it means the previous data with same timestamp has to be updated with this new price.
Else it's the new price of the commodity.
At any point of time the latest, max and min of the price has to be printed.
If the delete instruction is received through the stream, the min/max should be updated accordingly.

ans = AVL Tree with Key as Price and TimeStamp as Value. Finding Max and Min will be faster than latest Value

10. Card Game

Card game rule: the hand is drawn from a pack of cards (no jokers).
Play cards ONLY when they are
1. 3 of a kind ('AAA' ) or 4 of a kind('AAAA’).
2. a straight flush of 3 or more cards('JQK' or 'A23456...' in the same suit).
Find out whether the player is able to play the whole hand given.
e.g. [Spade A, Spade K, Spade Q, Diamond Q, Heart Q] return false.
[Spade A, Spade K, Spade Q, Diamond Q, Heart Q, Club Q] return true.

11. Given a list L of video names and their watch rates, 
write a function that will return the videos with the top 10 watch rates. Video names may appear more than once.

Example:

L = [(‘abc’, 10), (‘def’, 15), (‘ghi’, 10), (‘abc’, 12), …, (‘xyz’, 100)]

The function should return [‘xyz’, ‘abc’, …, ‘def’, ‘ghi’]

12. Write a function that takes a list L and returns a random sublist of size N of that list.
 Assume that the indexes must be in increasing order. That is, you cannot go backwards.

Example:

L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
N = 3

The function should return one of these lists:

[1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 4]
[1, 2, 5]
[1, 3, 4]
[1, 3, 5]
[1, 4, 5]
[2, 3, 4]
[2, 3, 5]
[2, 4, 5]
[3, 4, 5]


13. Consider an undirected tree with N nodes, numbered from 1 to N. Each node has a label associated with it, 
which is an integer value. Different nodes can have the same label. Write a function that, 
given a zero indexed array A of length N, where A[j] is the label value of the (j + 1)-th node in the tree 
and a zero-indexed array E of length K = (N – 1) * 2 in which the edges of the tree are described, 
returns the length of the longest path such that all the nodes on that path have the same label. 
The length is the number of edges in that path.

Example:

A = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
E = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]

This tree is shown below. A node follows the form label, value.

----------1, 1

-----1, 2 1, 3

2, 4 2, 5
The function should return 2, because the longest path is 2->1->3, and there are 2 edges in this path.

Assume that 1 <= N <= 1000 and each element of the array A is an integer in the range [1, 1000000000]. 

14. Given a string A consisting of n characters and a string B consisting of m characters, 
write a function that will return the number of times A must be stated such that B is a substring of the repeated A.
 If B can never be a substring, return -1.

Example:
A = ‘abcd’
B = ‘cdabcdab’
The function should return 3 because after stating A 3 times, getting ‘abcdabcdabcd’, B is now a substring of A.

You can assume that n and m are integers in the range [1, 1000].

15. Given 1-D list of co-ordinates determine if interval (a,b) is covered

Ex - [(2,5), (5,7),(1,4)] and interval = (1,6)
return true
Explanation - Points 1 to 6 lies in list of interval given 1 to 4. 2 to 5 and 5 to 7.

[(1,4),(6,7),(2,5)] and interval - (1,6)
return false
Explanation - Distance between 5 to 6 is not covered in the list given so return false

16. Compare two documents(string array) based on n grams.

27. Given various subsequences of an array, print the overall array:

Example: [1, 3, 5], [1, 3, 9], [9, 5]

28. A graph has N vertices numbered from 1 to N. We have two lists.
One list M consisted of edges between vertices. 
The other list K consists of restricted paths.
We have to add edges one by one from M and check whether the addition of the particular edge 
leads to a path between the restricted edges given in K. If it creates a path, we have to discard the edge.

Example: N = 4; K = {(1, 4)}; M = {(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)}. 
Here, addition of edge (3, 4) will create a path between 1 and 4. Hence we discard edge (3, 4)
